}
\arguments{
\item{main}{\code{character(1)} A regex string to search for in the \code{Maintainer}
column from the \code{biocPkgList()} output.}

\item{version}{character(1) the character version number
as used to access the online build report. For
example, "3.14". The default is the "current version"
as given by \code{BiocManager::version()}. Note
that this is a character vector of length one and not a number.}

\item{pkgType}{\code{character(1)} The type of packages for which to get build
status information for. Valid values are:
\itemize{
\item \code{software}: Software packages
\item \code{data-experiment}: Experiment data packages
\item \code{data-annotation}: Annotation data packages
\item \code{workflows}: Workflow packages
}}

\item{pkg}{\code{character(1)} A vector of package names (case sensitive).}

\item{repo}{\code{character()} A vector of Bioconductor repositories to search
through. By default, it will search through all Bioconductor repositories.}
}
\value{
For \code{biocMaintained}: a \code{tibble} of packages associated with the
maintainer.

For \code{hasBiocMaint}: a logical vector indicating whether the
package is maintained by Bioconductor.
}
\description{
List all the packages associated with a maintainer. By default, it will
return all packages associated with the \code{maintainer@bioconductor.org} email.
\code{hasBiocMaint} returns a logical vector corresponding to the input character
vector of packages indicating whether any package is maintained by the
Bioconductor core team.
