\title{Calculate dependency gain achieved by excluding combinations of packages}
\usage{
pkgCombDependencyGain(pkg, depdf, maxNbr = 3L)
}
\arguments{
\item{pkg}{character, the name of the package for which we want
to estimate the dependency gain}

\item{depdf}{a tidy data frame with package dependency information
obtained through the function \code{\link{buildPkgDependencyDataFrame}}}

\item{maxNbr}{numeric, the maximal number of direct dependencies to leave 
out simultaneously}
}
\value{
A data frame with three columns: ExclPackages (the excluded direct 
  dependencies), NbrExcl (the number of excluded direct dependencies),
  DepGain (the dependency gain from excluding these direct dependencies)
}
\description{
Calculate dependency gain achieved by excluding combinations of packages

\examples{
depdf <- buildPkgDependencyDataFrame(
  dependencies = c("Depends", "Imports"), 
  repo = names(BiocManager::repositories())
)
pcd <- pkgCombDependencyGain('GEOquery', depdf, maxNbr = 3L)
head(pcd[order(pcd$DepGain, decreasing = TRUE), ])
