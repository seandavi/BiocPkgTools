CHANGES IN VERSION 1.20.0
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o `biocDownloadStats` now filters out packages that are not part of the
      `pkgType` option and strictly returns stats for Bioconductor packages
    o When package stats are not available for a particular year,
      `biocDownloadStats` will warn about the year there is no data for.

BUG FIXES

    o `pkgDownloadRank` calculates the denominator for ranks using the `VIEWS`
    file; matches Bioc badges more closely.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.18.0
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o `biocLastBuildDate` has been deprecated and moved to `BiocArchive`.
    o `pkgBiocDeps` returns only the Bioconductor dependencies for a given
      vector of packages; can be set to all dependencies.

BUG FIXES

    o Use `bfcdownload` when a web resource needs updating. Functions that
    download and cache files are affected including `biocBuildReport`,
    `biocDownloadStats`, `biocPkgRanges`, and `CRANstatus`.
    o `biocPkgList` throws a descriptive error when using an alternative
      repository to the default CRAN, e.g., `RSPM` where the `packages.rds`
      file does not exist.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.16.0
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o `get_cre_orcids` and `orcid_table` allow the querying of the ORCID API
      to obtain information about the maintainer whose ORCID is documented
      in the `DESCRIPTION` file (@vjcitn)
    o `biocBuildEmail` now allows a `to` maintainer email override along with
      `cc` and `bcc` inputs.
    o `biocLastBuildDate` gives the date of the last release build for a
      particular release version as shown in the bioconductor.org website
    o The argument defaults for `buildPkgDependencyDataFrame` have changed to
      match that of `tools::package_dependencies` which is more appropriate for
      identifying "strong" dependencies (@vjcitn, #55).
    o `latestPkgStats`, `activitySince`, and `pkgDownloadRank` are designed to
      pull package statistics from the GitHub API using `gh` packages or from
      Bioconductor. They are esp. useful for reporting to funding agencies.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.12.0
-------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o `biocRevDepEmail` sends an email to several downstream maintainers to
      notify them of a deprecated package.
    o `biocBuildEmail` allows deprecation notices using the template in the
      `inst` folder. Use `templatePath()` to see available templates by their
      location.
    o `PackageStatus` indicates whether a package is slated for
      'Deprecation' by checking the `meat-index.dcf` file.
    o `pkgDownloadStats` provides the download statistics table for a
      particular package.

BUG FIXES

    o `biocBuildReport` refers to hard-coded versions of the BBS build reports
      corresponding to when changes were made.
    o `biocDownloadStats` includes all types of Bioconductor packages
    o `biocBuildReport` improved to work on old-rel, release, and devel
      Bioconductor versions

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.10.0

      the build report for a specified range of packages (ordered
      alphabetically)
    o `biocBuildEmail` provides core-team functionality for sending email
      notifications to package maintainers

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o `biocBuildEmail` allows for saving a credentials file for email
      authentication via the `credFile` argument
    o `setCache` uses `tools::R_user_dir("BiocPkgTools", "cache")` instead of
      `rappdirs::user_cache_dir`

BUG FIXES

    o `biocBuildReport` accounts for some packages whose `DESCRIPTION` file is
      malformed
    o `biocBuildReport` updated to changes in the build report format

    o Add HTML Package Report template as RStudio rmarkdown
      template to quickly generate overviews of package stats

      search and browse by term
