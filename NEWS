CHANGES IN VERSION 1.20.0
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o `biocRevDepEmail` accepts a vector of deprecated packages for whose
      reverse dependencies are to be notified.
    o `biocDownloadStats` now filters out packages that are not part of the
      `pkgType` option and strictly returns stats for Bioconductor packages
    o When package stats are not available for a particular year,
      `biocDownloadStats` will warn about the year there is no data for.
    o `biocLastBuildDate` has been defunct and its functionality disabled.

BUG FIXES

    o Warn when a download stats URL is not available and filter out in

    download and cache files are affected including `biocBuildReport`,
    `biocDownloadStats`, `biocPkgRanges`, and `CRANstatus`.
    o `biocPkgList` throws a descriptive error when using an alternative
      repository to the default CRAN, e.g., `RSPM` where the `packages.rds`

      particular release version as shown in the bioconductor.org website
    o The argument defaults for `buildPkgDependencyDataFrame` have changed to
      match that of `tools::package_dependencies` which is more appropriate for
      identifying "strong" dependencies (@vjcitn, #55).
    o `latestPkgStats`, `activitySince`, and `pkgDownloadRank` are designed to
      pull package statistics from the GitHub API using `gh` packages or from
      Bioconductor. They are esp. useful for reporting to funding agencies.
