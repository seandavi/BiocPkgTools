<p>Because developers may be interested in a quick view of their own packages, there is a simple function, <code>problemPage</code>, to produce an HTML report of the build status of packages matching a given author <em>regex</em> supplied to the <code>authorPattern</code> argument. The default is to report only “problem” build statuses (ERROR, WARNING).</p>

<p>In similar fashion, maintainers of packages that have many downstream packages that depend on them may wish to check that a change they introduced hasn’t suddenly broken a large number of these. You can use the <code>dependsOn</code> argument to produce the summary report of those packages that “depend on” the given package.</p>

<p>When run in an interactive environment, the <code>problemPage</code> function will open a browser window for user interaction. Note that if you want to include all your package results, not just the broken ones, simply specify <code>includeOK = TRUE</code>.</p>

BASiCS provides an\nintuitive detection criterion for highly (or lowly) variable\ngenes within a single group of cells. Additionally, BASiCS can\ncompare gene expression patterns between two or more\npre-specified groups of cells. Unlike traditional differential\nexpression tools, BASiCS quantifies changes in expression that\nlie beyond comparisons of means, also allowing the study of\nchanges in cell-to-cell heterogeneity. The latter can be\nquantified via a biological over-dispersion parameter that\nmeasures the excess of variability that is observed with\nrespect to Poisson sampling noise, after normalisation and\ntechnical noise removal. Due to the strong mean/over-dispersion\nconfounding that is typically observed for scRNA-seq datasets,\nBASiCS also tests for changes in residual over-dispersion,\ndefined by residual values with respect to a global\nmean/over-dispersion trend.","downloads_month":10,"downloads_total":10540,"page":"https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/BASiCS.html"},{"authors":"Annika Buerger","name":"BasicSTARRseq","license":"LGPL-3","tags":["Software","BiologicalQuestion","ResearchField","PeakDetection","GeneRegulation","FunctionalPrediction","FunctionalGenomics","Coverage"],"description":"Basic peak calling on STARR-seq data based on a method\nintroduced in \"Genome-Wide Quantitative Enhancer Activity Maps\nIdentified by STARR-seq\" Arnold et al.

Revealing unknown\ncompound-protein interactions is useful to design a new drug\nfor a target protein by screening candidate compounds. The\naccurate CPI prediction assists in effective drug discovery\nprocess. To identify potential CPI effectively, prediction\nmethods based on machine learning and deep learning have been\ndeveloped. Data for sequences are provided as discrete symbolic\ndata. In the data, compounds are represented as SMILES\n(simplified molecular-input line-entry system) strings and\nproteins are sequences in which the characters are amino acids.\nThe outcome is defined as a variable that indicates how strong\ntwo molecules interact with each other or whether there is an\ninteraction between them. In this package, a deep-learning\nbased model that takes only sequence information of both\ncompounds and proteins as input and the outcome as output is\nused to predict CPI. The model is implemented by using compound\nand protein encoders with useful features. The CPI model also\nsupports other modeling tasks, including protein-protein\ninteraction (PPI), chemical-chemical interaction (CCI), or\nsingle compounds and proteins. Although the model is designed\nfor proteins, DNA and RNA can be used if they are represented\nas sequences.","downloads_month":2,"downloads_total":617,"page":"https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DeepPINCS.html"},{"authors":"Niko Beerenwinkel, Raul Alcantara, David Jones, Inigo Martincorena and Moritz Gerstung","name":"deepSNV","license":"GPL-3","tags":["Software","AssayDomain","Technology","ResearchField","Infrastructure","GeneticVariability","SNP","Sequencing","Genetics","DataImport"],"description":"This package provides provides quantitative variant\ncallers for detecting subclonal mutations in ultra-deep (>=100x\ncoverage) sequencing experiments.

More precisely, the algorithm\nfinds pairs of genes that are mutated in the same tumor but in\ndifferent clones, i.e. their subclonal mutation profiles are\nmutually exclusive. We refer to this as clonally exclusive. It\nmeans that the mutations occurred in different branches of the\ntumor phylogeny, indicating parallel evolution of the clones.\nOur statistical framework assesses whether a pattern of clonal\nexclusivity occurs more often than expected by chance alone\nacross a cohort of patients. The required input data are the\nmutated gene-to-clone assignments from a cohort of cancer\npatients, which were obtained by running phylogenetic tree\ninference methods. Reconstructing the evolutionary history of a\ntumor and detecting the clones is challenging. For\nnondeterministic algorithms, repeated tree inference runs may\nlead to slightly different mutation-to-clone assignments.\nTherefore, our algorithm was designed to allow the input of\nmultiple gene-to-clone assignments per patient. They may have\nbeen generated by repeatedly performing the tree inference, or\nby sampling from the posterior distribution of trees. The tree\ninference methods designate the mutations to individual clones.\nThe mutations can then be mapped to genes or pathways. Hence\nour statistical framework can be applied on the gene level, or\non the pathway level to detect clonally exclusive pairs of\npathways. If a pair is significantly clonally exclusive, it\npoints towards the fact that this specific clone configuration\nconfers a selective advantage, possibly through synergies\nbetween the clones with these mutations.","downloads_month":4,"downloads_total":3488,"page":"https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GeneAccord.html"},{"authors":"Lei Huang, Gang Feng, Pan Du, Tian Xia, Xishu Wang, Jing, Wen, Warren Kibbe and Simon Lin","name":"GeneAnswers","license":"LGPL (>= 2)","tags":["Software","Infrastructure","WorkflowStep","DataRepresentation","Visualization","GraphsAndNetworks"],"description":"GeneAnswers provides an integrated tool for biological or\nmedical interpretation of the given one or more groups of genes\nby means of statistical test.","downloads_month":4,"downloads_total":48253,"page":"https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GeneAnswers.html"},{"authors":"Arthur Wuster","name":"geneAttribution","license":"Artistic-2.0","tags":["Software","AssayDomain","BiologicalQuestion","SNP","GenePrediction","GenomeWideAssociation","VariantAnnotation","GenomicVariation"],"description":"Identification of the most likely gene or genes through\nwhich variation at a given genomic locus in the human genome\nacts.

Over-representation analysis (ORA) of genes was\ndeveloped to identify biological themes. Given a Gene Ontology\n(GO) and an annotation of genes that indicate the categories\neach one fits into, significance of the over-representation of\nthe genes within the ontological categories is determined by a\nFisher's exact test or modeling according to a hypergeometric\ndistribution. Comparing a small number of enriched biological\ncategories for a few samples is manageable using Venn diagrams\nor other means for assessing overlaps. However, with hundreds\nof enriched categories and many samples, the comparisons are\nlaborious. Furthermore, if there are enriched categories that\nare shared between samples, trying to represent a common theme\nacross them is highly subjective. goSTAG uses GO subtrees to\ntag and annotate genes within a set. goSTAG visualizes the\nsimilarities between the over-representation of DEGs by\nclustering the p-values from the enrichment statistical tests\nand labels clusters with the GO term that has the most paths to\nthe root within the subtree generated from all the GO terms in\nthe cluster.","downloads_month":9,"downloads_total":6557,"page":"https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/goSTAG.html"},{"authors":"Robert Gentleman, Seth Falcon, Robert Castelo and Bioconductor Package Maintainer","name":"GOstats","license":"Artistic-2.0","tags":["Software","WorkflowStep","Pathways","AssayDomain","Technology","BiologicalQuestion","StatisticalMethod","Annotation","GO","MultipleComparison","GeneExpression","Microarray","GeneSetEnrichment","GraphAndNetwork"],"description":"A set of tools for interacting with GO and microarray\ndata.

Unfortunately, although it was designed to help\nresearchers to interpret gene expression data it can generate\nhuge amounts of results whose biological meaning can be\ndifficult to interpret. Many available tools rely on the\nhierarchically structured Gene Ontology (GO) classification to\nreduce reundandcy in the results. However, due to the\npopularity of GSEA many more gene set collections, such as\nthose in the Molecular Signatures Database are emerging. Since\nthese collections are not organized as those in GO, their usage\nfor GSEA do not always give a straightforward answer or, in\nother words, getting all the meaninful information can be\nchallenging with the currently available tools. For these\nreasons, GSEAmining was born to be an easy tool to create\nreproducible reports to help researchers make biological sense\nof GSEA outputs. Given the results of GSEA, GSEAmining clusters\nthe different gene sets collections based on the presence of\nthe same genes in the leadind edge (core) subset. Leading edge\nsubsets are those genes that contribute most to the enrichment\nscore of each collection of genes or gene sets. For this\nreason, gene sets that participate in similar biological\nprocesses should share genes in common and in turn cluster\ntogether. After that, GSEAmining is able to identify and\nrepresent for each cluster: - The most enriched terms in the\nnames of gene sets (as wordclouds) - The most enriched genes in\nthe leading edge subsets (as bar plots). In each case, positive\nand negative enrichments are shown in different colors so it is\neasy to distinguish biological processes or genes that may be\nof interest in that particular study.","downloads_month":3,"downloads_total":1391,"page":"https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GSEAmining.html"},{"authors":"Dongmin Jung","name":"gsean","license":"Artistic-2.0","tags":["Software","WorkflowStep","Visualization","StatisticalMethod","BiologicalQuestion","AssayDomain","Network","GraphAndNetwork","GeneSetEnrichment","GeneExpression","NetworkEnrichment","Pathways","DifferentialExpression"],"description":"Biological molecules in a living organism seldom work\nindividually.

The present methods usually involve\nnormalization of the data with a scaling factor, followed by\ndetection of significant genes. However, more than one scaling\nfactor may exist because of the complexity of real data.\nConsequently, methods that normalize data by a single scaling\nfactor may deliver suboptimal performance or may not even work.\nThe development of modern machine learning techniques has\nprovided a new perspective regarding discrimination between\ndifferentially expressed (DE) and non-DE genes. However, in\nreality, the non-DE genes comprise only a small set and may\ncontain housekeeping genes (in same species) or conserved\northologous genes (in different species). Therefore, the\nprocess of detecting DE genes can be formulated as a one-class\nclassification problem, where only non-DE genes are observed,\nwhile DE genes are completely absent from the training data. We\ntransform the problem to an outlier detection problem by\ntreating DE genes as outliers, and we propose a\nnormalization-invariant minimum enclosing ball (NIMEB) method\nto construct a smallest possible ball to contain the known\nnon-DE genes in a feature space. The genes outside the minimum\nenclosing ball can then be naturally considered to be DE genes.\nCompared with the existing methods, the proposed NIMEB method\ndoes not require data normalization, which is particularly\nattractive when the RNA-seq data include more than one scaling\nfactor. Furthermore, the NIMEB method could be easily extended\nto different species without normalization.","downloads_month":6,"downloads_total":2454,"page":"https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MEB.html"},{"authors":"Lukas Chavez, Matthias Lienhard, Joern Dietrich and Isaac Lopez Moyado","name":"MEDIPS","license":"GPL (>=2)","tags":["Software","AssayDomain","BiologicalQuestion","Technology","Sequencing","WorkflowStep","ResearchField","DNAMethylation","CpGIsland","DifferentialExpression","ChIPSeq","Preprocessing","QualityControl","Visualization","Microarray","Genetics","Coverage","GenomeAnnotation","CopyNumberVariation","SequenceMatching"],"description":"MEDIPS was developed for analyzing data derived from\nmethylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) experiments followed\nby sequencing (MeDIP-seq).

Results: We present\nan R/bioconductor package called MoonlightR which returns a\nlist of candidate driver genes for specific cancer types on the\nbasis of TCGA expression data. The method first infers gene\nregulatory networks and then carries out a functional\nenrichment analysis (FEA) (implementing an upstream regulator\nanalysis, URA) to score the importance of well-known biological\nprocesses with respect to the studied cancer type. Eventually,\nby means of random forests, MoonlightR predicts two specific\nroles for the candidate driver genes: i) tumor suppressor genes\n(TSGs) and ii) oncogenes (OCGs). As a consequence, this\nmethodology does not only identify genes playing a dual role\n(e.g. TSG in one cancer type and OCG in another) but also helps\nin elucidating the biological processes underlying their\nspecific roles. In particular, MoonlightR can be used to\ndiscover OCGs and TSGs in the same cancer type. This may help\nin answering the question whether some genes change role\nbetween early stages (I, II) and late stages (III, IV) in\nbreast cancer.

With this respect the huge number of experimental\nmass spectra typically have to be assigned to theoretical\npeptides derived from a sequence database. Search engines are\nused for this purpose. These tools compare each of the observed\nspectra to all candidate theoretical spectra derived from the\nsequence data base and calculate a score for each comparison.\nThe observed spectrum is then assigned to the theoretical\npeptide with the best score, which is also referred to as the\npeptide to spectrum match (PSM). It is of course crucial for\nthe downstream analysis to evaluate the quality of these\nmatches. Therefore False Discovery Rate (FDR) control is used\nto return a reliable list PSMs. The FDR, however, requires a\ngood characterisation of the score distribution of PSMs that\nare matched to the wrong peptide (bad target hits). In\nproteomics, the target decoy approach (TDA) is typically used\nfor this purpose. The TDA method matches the spectra to a\ndatabase of real (targets) and nonsense peptides (decoys). A\npopular approach to generate these decoys is to reverse the\ntarget database. Hence, all the PSMs that match to a decoy are\nknown to be bad hits and the distribution of their scores are\nused to estimate the distribution of the bad scoring target\nPSMs. A crucial assumption of the TDA is that the decoy PSM\nhits have similar properties as bad target hits so that the\ndecoy PSM scores are a good simulation of the target PSM\nscores. Users, however, typically do not evaluate these\nassumptions. To this end we developed TargetDecoy to generate\ndiagnostic plots to evaluate the quality of the target decoy\nmethod.","downloads_month":5,"downloads_total":121,"page":"https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/TargetDecoy.html"},{"authors":"Yue Li","name":"TargetScore","license":"GPL-2","tags":["Software","Technology","Sequencing","miRNA"],"description":"Infer the posterior distributions of microRNA targets by\nprobabilistically modelling the likelihood\nmicroRNA-overexpression fold-changes and sequence-based scores.\nVariaitonal Bayesian Gaussian mixture model (VB-GMM) is applied\nto log fold-changes and sequence scores to obtain the\nposteriors of latent variable being the miRNA targets.

<p>The Bioconductor ecosystem is built around the concept of interoperability and dependencies. These interdependencies are available as part of the <code><a href="../reference/biocPkgList.html">biocPkgList()</a></code> output. The <code>BiocPkgTools</code> provides some convenience functions to convert package dependencies to R graphs. A modular approach leads to the following workflow.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Create a <code>data.frame</code> of dependencies using <code>buildPkgDependencyDataFrame</code>.</li>
<li>Create an <code>igraph</code> object from the dependency data frame using <code>buildPkgDependencyIgraph</code>
</li>
<li>Use native <code>igraph</code> functionality to perform arbitrary network operations. Convenience functions, <code>inducedSubgraphByPkgs</code> and <code>subgraphByDegree</code> are available.</li>
<li>Visualize with packages such as <em><a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=visNetwork" class="external-link">visNetwork</a></em>.</li>

<p>The visNetwork package is a nice interactive visualization tool that implements graph plotting in a browser. It can be integrated into shiny applications. Interactive graphs can also be included in Rmarkdown documents (see vignette)</p>

<p>The full dependency graph is really not that informative to look at, though doing so is possible. A common use case is to visualize the graph of dependencies “centered” on a package of interest. In this case, I will focus on the <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.14/GEOquery" class="external-link">GEOquery</a></em> package.</p>

<p>The <code><a href="../reference/subgraphByDegree.html">subgraphByDegree()</a></code> function returns all nodes and connections within <code>degree</code> of the named package; the default <code>degree</code> is <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>The visNework package can plot <code>igraph</code> objects directly, but more flexibility is offered by first converting the graph to visNetwork form.</p>

</h1>
<p>The dependency burden of a package, namely the amount of functionality that a given package is importing, is an important parameter to take into account during package development. A package may break because one or more of its dependencies have changed the part of the API our package is importing or this part has even broken. For this reason, it may be useful for package developers to quantify the dependency burden of a given package. To do that we should first gather all dependency information using the function <code><a href="../reference/buildPkgDependencyDataFrame.html">buildPkgDependencyDataFrame()</a></code> but setting the arguments to work with packages in Bioconductor and CRAN and dependencies categorised as <code>Depends</code> or <code>Imports</code>, which are the ones installed by default for a given package.</p>

<p>In this resulting table, rows correspond to dependencies and columns provide the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>ImportedAndUsed</code>: number of functionality calls imported and used in the package.</li>
<li>
<code>Exported</code>: number of functionality calls exported by the dependency.</li>
<li>
<code>Usage</code>: (<code>ImportedAndUsed</code>x 100) / <code>Exported</code>. This value provides an estimate of what fraction of the functionality of the dependency is actually used in the given package.</li>
<li>
<code>DepOverlap</code>: Similarity between the dependency graph structure of the given package and the one of the dependency in the corresponding row, estimated as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index" class="external-link">Jaccard index</a> between the two sets of vertices of the corresponding graphs. Its values goes between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates that no dependency is shared, while 1 indicates that the given package and the corresponding dependency depend on an identical subset of packages.</li>
<li>
<code>DepGainIfExcluded</code>: The ‘dependency gain’ (decrease in the total number of dependencies) that would be obtained if this package was excluded from the list of direct dependencies.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reported information is ordered by the <code>Usage</code> column to facilitate the identification of dependencies for which the analyzed package is using a small fraction of their functionality and therefore, it could be easier remove them. To aid in that decision, the column <code>DepOverlap</code> reports the overlap of the dependency graph of each dependency with the one of the analyzed package. Here a value above, e.g., 0.5, could, albeit not necessarily, imply that removing that dependency could substantially lighten the dependency burden of the analyzed package.</p>
<p>An <code>NA</code> value in the <code>ImportedAndUsed</code> column indicates that the function <code><a href="../reference/pkgDepMetrics.html">pkgDepMetrics()</a></code> could not identify what functionality calls in the analyzed package are made to the dependency. This may happen because <code><a href="../reference/pkgDepMetrics.html">pkgDepMetrics()</a></code> has failed to identify the corresponding calls, as it happens with imported built-in constants such as <code>DNA_BASES</code> from <code>Biostrings</code>, or that although the given package is importing that dependency, none of its functionality is actually being used. In such a case, this dependency could be safely removed without any further change in the analyzed package.</p>
