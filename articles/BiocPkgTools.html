However, they are not very computable. The <code>biocBuildReport</code>
function does some heroic parsing of the HTML to produce a <em>tidy</em>
data.frame for further processing in R.</p>

<p>Because developers may be interested in a quick view of their own
packages, there is a simple function, <code>problemPage</code>, to
produce an HTML report of the build status of packages matching a given
author <em>regex</em> supplied to the <code>authorPattern</code>
argument. The default is to report only “problem” build statuses (ERROR,
WARNING).</p>

<p>In similar fashion, maintainers of packages that have many downstream
packages that depend on them may wish to check that a change they
introduced hasn’t suddenly broken a large number of these. You can use
the <code>dependsOn</code> argument to produce the summary report of
those packages that “depend on” the given package.</p>

<p>When run in an interactive environment, the <code>problemPage</code>
function will open a browser window for user interaction. Note that if
you want to include all your package results, not just the broken ones,
simply specify <code>includeOK = TRUE</code>.</p>

<p>The download statistics reported are for <strong><em>all available
versions</em></strong> of a package. There are no separate, publicly
available statistics broken down by version. The majority of
Bioconductor Software packages are also available through other channels
such as Anaconda, who also provided download statistics for packages
installed from their repositories. Access to these counts is provided by
the <code>anacondaDownloadStats</code> function:</p>

The model is implemented by using compound\nand protein encoders with useful features. The CPI model also\nsupports other modeling tasks, including protein-protein\ninteraction (PPI), chemical-chemical interaction (CCI), or\nsingle compounds and proteins.

For instance,\ndifferentially expressed genes (DEGs) from a microarray or\nRNA-Seq analysis are related functionally in terms of their\nresponse to a treatment or condition. Gene lists can vary in\nsize, up to several thousand genes, depending on the robustness\nof the perturbations or how widely different the conditions are\nbiologically. Having a way to associate biological relatedness\nbetween hundreds and thousands of genes systematically is\nimpractical by manually curating the annotation and function of\neach gene. Over-representation analysis (ORA) of genes was\ndeveloped to identify biological themes. Given a Gene Ontology\n(GO) and an annotation of genes that indicate the categories\neach one fits into, significance of the over-representation of\nthe genes within the ontological categories is determined by a\nFisher's exact test or modeling according to a hypergeometric\ndistribution. Comparing a small number of enriched biological\ncategories for a few samples is manageable using Venn diagrams\nor other means for assessing overlaps. However, with hundreds\nof enriched categories and many samples, the comparisons are\nlaborious. Furthermore, if there are enriched categories that\nare shared between samples, trying to represent a common theme\nacross them is highly subjective. goSTAG uses GO subtrees to\ntag and annotate genes within a set. goSTAG visualizes the\nsimilarities between the over-representation of DEGs by\nclustering the p-values from the enrichment statistical tests\nand labels clusters with the GO term that has the most paths to\nthe root within the subtree generated from all the GO terms in\nthe cluster.","downloads_month":401,"downloads_total":13180,"page":"https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/goSTAG.html"},{"authors":"Robert Gentleman, Seth Falcon, Robert Castelo, Sonali Kumari, Dennis Ndubi and Bioconductor Package Maintainer","name":"GOstats","license":"Artistic-2.0","tags":["Software","WorkflowStep","Pathways","AssayDomain","Technology","BiologicalQuestion","StatisticalMethod","Annotation","GO","MultipleComparison","GeneExpression","Microarray","GeneSetEnrichment","GraphAndNetwork"],"description":"A set of tools for interacting with GO and microarray\ndata.

To\nunderstand the effects of genetic variants in these regulatory\nregions, identifying genes that are modulated by specific\nregulatory elements (REs) is crucial.

This TF activity can be quantified\nwith existing tools such as diffTF and captures differences in\nbinding of a TF in open chromatin regions.

Unfortunately, although it was designed to help\nresearchers to interpret gene expression data it can generate\nhuge amounts of results whose biological meaning can be\ndifficult to interpret. Many available tools rely on the\nhierarchically structured Gene Ontology (GO) classification to\nreduce reundandcy in the results. However, due to the\npopularity of GSEA many more gene set collections, such as\nthose in the Molecular Signatures Database are emerging. Since\nthese collections are not organized as those in GO, their usage\nfor GSEA do not always give a straightforward answer or, in\nother words, getting all the meaninful information can be\nchallenging with the currently available tools. For these\nreasons, GSEAmining was born to be an easy tool to create\nreproducible reports to help researchers make biological sense\nof GSEA outputs. Given the results of GSEA, GSEAmining clusters\nthe different gene sets collections based on the presence of\nthe same genes in the leadind edge (core) subset. Leading edge\nsubsets are those genes that contribute most to the enrichment\nscore of each collection of genes or gene sets. For this\nreason, gene sets that participate in similar biological\nprocesses should share genes in common and in turn cluster\ntogether. After that, GSEAmining is able to identify and\nrepresent for each cluster: - The most enriched terms in the\nnames of gene sets (as wordclouds) - The most enriched genes in\nthe leading edge subsets (as bar plots). In each case, positive\nand negative enrichments are shown in different colors so it is\neasy to distinguish biological processes or genes that may be\nof interest in that particular study.","downloads_month":345,"downloads_total":7369,"page":"https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GSEAmining.html"},{"authors":"Dongmin Jung","name":"gsean","license":"Artistic-2.0","tags":["Software","WorkflowStep","Visualization","StatisticalMethod","BiologicalQuestion","AssayDomain","Network","GraphAndNetwork","GeneSetEnrichment","GeneExpression","NetworkEnrichment","Pathways","DifferentialExpression"],"description":"Biological molecules in a living organism seldom work\nindividually.

We\nfurther identify isoforms where the relative abundance of\nproteins and transcripts significantly differ. We use a\ntwo-layer latent variable approach to model two sources of\nuncertainty typical of MS data: i) peptides may be erroneously\ndetected (even when absent); ii) many peptides are compatible\nwith multiple protein isoforms. In the first layer, we sample\nthe presence/absence of each peptide based on its estimated\nprobability of being mistakenly detected, also known as PEP\n(i.e., posterior error probability).

We present an updated version\nof the R/bioconductor package called MoonlightR, namely\nMoonlight2R, which returns a list of candidate driver genes for\nspecific cancer types on the basis of omics data integration.\nThe Moonlight framework contains a primary layer where gene\nexpression data and information about biological processes are\nintegrated to predict genes called oncogenic mediators, divided\ninto putative tumor suppressors and putative oncogenes. This is\ndone through functional enrichment analyses, gene regulatory\nnetworks and upstream regulator analyses to score the\nimportance of well-known biological processes with respect to\nthe studied cancer type. By evaluating the effect of the\noncogenic mediators on biological processes or through random\nforests, the primary layer predicts two putative roles for the\noncogenic mediators: i) tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) and ii)\noncogenes (OCGs). As gene expression data alone is not enough\nto explain the deregulation of the genes, a second layer of\nevidence is needed. We have automated the integration of a\nsecondary mutational layer through new functionalities in\nMoonlight2R. These functionalities analyze mutations in the\ncancer cohort and classifies these into driver and passenger\nmutations using the driver mutation prediction tool,\nCScape-somatic. Those oncogenic mediators with at least one\ndriver mutation are retained as the driver genes. As a\nconsequence, this methodology does not only identify genes\nplaying a dual role (e.g. TSG in one cancer type and OCG in\nanother) but also helps in elucidating the biological processes\nunderlying their specific roles. In particular, Moonlight2R can\nbe used to discover OCGs and TSGs in the same cancer type. This\nmay for instance help in answering the question whether some\ngenes change role between early stages (I, II) and late stages\n(III, IV). In the future, this analysis could be useful to\ndetermine the causes of different resistances to\nchemotherapeutic treatments.

A faster method uses principal component analysis (PCA)\nto avoid binning genes while still retaining outcome\ninformation in the MI models. Binning genes into smaller groups\nrequires that the MI and limma-voom analysis is run many times\n(typically hundreds). The more computationally efficient MI PCA\nmethod implements covariate MI in gene expression studies by 1)\nperforming PCA on the log CPM values for all genes using the\nBioconductor `PCAtools` package, 2) creating M imputed datasets\nwhere the imputation predictor matrix includes all covariates\nand the optimum number of PCs to retain (e.g., based on Horn’s\nparallel analysis or the number of PCs that account for >80%\nexplained variation), 3) conducting the standard limma-voom\npipeline with the `voom` followed by `lmFit` followed by\n`eBayes` functions on each M imputed dataset, 4) pooling the\nresults with Rubins’ rules to produce combined coefficients,\nstandard errors, and P-values, and 5) adjusting P-values for\nmultiplicity to account for false discovery rate (FDR).","downloads_month":226,"downloads_total":3234,"page":"https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/RNAseqCovarImpute.html"},{"authors":"Terry M Therneau and Hart Stephen","name":"RNASeqPower","license":"LGPL (>=2)","tags":["Software","ResearchField","Technology","Sequencing","ImmunoOncology","RNASeq"],"description":"RNA-seq, sample size","downloads_month":480,"downloads_total":36999,"page":"https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/RNASeqPower.html"},{"authors":"Shilin Zhao Developer, Chung-I Li, Yan Guo, Quanhu Sheng and Yu Shyr","name":"RnaSeqSampleSize","license":"GPL (>= 2)","tags":["Software","ResearchField","WorkflowStep","Technology","Sequencing","AssayDomain","BiologicalQuestion","ImmunoOncology","ExperimentalDesign","RNASeq","GeneExpression","DifferentialExpression"],"description":"RnaSeqSampleSize package provides a sample size\ncalculation method based on negative binomial model and the\nexact test for assessing differential expression analysis of\nRNA-seq data.

With this respect the huge number of experimental\nmass spectra typically have to be assigned to theoretical\npeptides derived from a sequence database. Search engines are\nused for this purpose. These tools compare each of the observed\nspectra to all candidate theoretical spectra derived from the\nsequence data base and calculate a score for each comparison.\nThe observed spectrum is then assigned to the theoretical\npeptide with the best score, which is also referred to as the\npeptide to spectrum match (PSM). It is of course crucial for\nthe downstream analysis to evaluate the quality of these\nmatches. Therefore False Discovery Rate (FDR) control is used\nto return a reliable list PSMs. The FDR, however, requires a\ngood characterisation of the score distribution of PSMs that\nare matched to the wrong peptide (bad target hits). In\nproteomics, the target decoy approach (TDA) is typically used\nfor this purpose. The TDA method matches the spectra to a\ndatabase of real (targets) and nonsense peptides (decoys). A\npopular approach to generate these decoys is to reverse the\ntarget database. Hence, all the PSMs that match to a decoy are\nknown to be bad hits and the distribution of their scores are\nused to estimate the distribution of the bad scoring target\nPSMs. A crucial assumption of the TDA is that the decoy PSM\nhits have similar properties as bad target hits so that the\ndecoy PSM scores are a good simulation of the target PSM\nscores. Users, however, typically do not evaluate these\nassumptions. To this end we developed TargetDecoy to generate\ndiagnostic plots to evaluate the quality of the target decoy\nmethod.","downloads_month":330,"downloads_total":5638,"page":"https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/TargetDecoy.html"},{"authors":"Yue Li","name":"TargetScore","license":"GPL-2","tags":["Software","Technology","Sequencing","miRNA"],"description":"Infer the posterior distributions of microRNA targets by\nprobabilistically modelling the likelihood\nmicroRNA-overexpression fold-changes and sequence-based scores.\nVariaitonal Bayesian Gaussian mixture model (VB-GMM) is applied\nto log fold-changes and sequence scores to obtain the\nposteriors of latent variable being the miRNA targets.

</h2>
<p>The Bioconductor ecosystem is built around the concept of
interoperability and dependencies. These interdependencies are available
as part of the <code><a href="../reference/biocPkgList.html">biocPkgList()</a></code> output. The
<code>BiocPkgTools</code> provides some convenience functions to convert
package dependencies to R graphs. A modular approach leads to the
following workflow.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Create a <code>data.frame</code> of dependencies using
<code>buildPkgDependencyDataFrame</code>.</li>
<li>Create an <code>igraph</code> object from the dependency data frame
using <code>buildPkgDependencyIgraph</code>
</li>
<li>Use native <code>igraph</code> functionality to perform arbitrary
network operations. Convenience functions,
<code>inducedSubgraphByPkgs</code> and <code>subgraphByDegree</code> are
available.</li>
<li>Visualize with packages such as <em><a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=visNetwork" class="external-link">visNetwork</a></em>.</li>

<p>The visNetwork package is a nice interactive visualization tool that
implements graph plotting in a browser. It can be integrated into shiny
applications. Interactive graphs can also be included in Rmarkdown

<p>The full dependency graph is really not that informative to look at,
though doing so is possible. A common use case is to visualize the graph
of dependencies “centered” on a package of interest. In this case, I
will focus on the <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/GEOquery" class="external-link">GEOquery</a></em>
package.</p>

<p>The <code><a href="../reference/subgraphByDegree.html">subgraphByDegree()</a></code> function returns all nodes and
connections within <code>degree</code> of the named package; the default
<code>degree</code> is <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>The visNework package can plot <code>igraph</code> objects directly,
but more flexibility is offered by first converting the graph to
visNetwork form.</p>

</h2>
<p>The dependency burden of a package, namely the amount of
functionality that a given package is importing, is an important
parameter to take into account during package development. A package may
break because one or more of its dependencies have changed the part of
the API our package is importing or this part has even broken. For this
reason, it may be useful for package developers to quantify the
dependency burden of a given package. To do that we should first gather
all dependency information using the function
<code><a href="../reference/buildPkgDependencyDataFrame.html">buildPkgDependencyDataFrame()</a></code> but setting the arguments to
work with packages in Bioconductor and CRAN and dependencies categorised
as <code>Depends</code> or <code>Imports</code>, which are the ones
installed by default for a given package.</p>

itself:</p>

<p>In this resulting table, rows correspond to dependencies and columns
provide the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>ImportedAndUsed</code>: number of functionality calls imported
and used in the package.</li>
<li>
<code>Exported</code>: number of functionality calls exported by the
dependency.</li>
<li>
<code>Usage</code>: (<code>ImportedAndUsed</code>x 100) /
<code>Exported</code>. This value provides an estimate of what fraction
of the functionality of the dependency is actually used in the given
package.</li>
<li>
<code>DepOverlap</code>: Similarity between the dependency graph
structure of the given package and the one of the dependency in the
corresponding row, estimated as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index" class="external-link">Jaccard index</a>
between the two sets of vertices of the corresponding graphs. Its values
goes between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates that no dependency is shared,
while 1 indicates that the given package and the corresponding
dependency depend on an identical subset of packages.</li>
<li>
<code>DepGainIfExcluded</code>: The ‘dependency gain’ (decrease in
the total number of dependencies) that would be obtained if this package
was excluded from the list of direct dependencies.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reported information is ordered by the <code>Usage</code> column
to facilitate the identification of dependencies for which the analyzed
package is using a small fraction of their functionality and therefore,
it could be easier remove them. To aid in that decision, the column
<code>DepOverlap</code> reports the overlap of the dependency graph of
each dependency with the one of the analyzed package. Here a value
above, e.g., 0.5, could, albeit not necessarily, imply that removing
that dependency could substantially lighten the dependency burden of the
analyzed package.</p>
<p>An <code>NA</code> value in the <code>ImportedAndUsed</code> column
indicates that the function <code><a href="../reference/pkgDepMetrics.html">pkgDepMetrics()</a></code> could not
identify what functionality calls in the analyzed package are made to
the dependency. This may happen because <code><a href="../reference/pkgDepMetrics.html">pkgDepMetrics()</a></code> has
failed to identify the corresponding calls, as it happens with imported
built-in constants such as <code>DNA_BASES</code> from
<code>Biostrings</code>, or that although the given package is importing
that dependency, none of its functionality is actually being used. In
such a case, this dependency could be safely removed without any further
change in the analyzed package.</p>
<p>We can find out what actually functionality calls are we importing as
follows:</p>

<h2 id="identities-of-maintainers">Identities of maintainers<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#identities-of-maintainers"></a>
</h2>
<p>It is important to be able to identify the maintainer of a package in
a reliable way. The DESCRIPTION file for a package can include an
<code>Authors@R</code> field. This field can capture metadata about
maintainers and contributors in a programmatically accessible way. Each
element of the role field of a <code>person</code> (see
<code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/person.html" class="external-link">?person</a></code>) in the <code>Authors@R</code> field comes from a
subset of the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/marc/relators/relaterm.html" class="external-link">relations
vocabulary of the Library of Congress</a>.</p>
<p>Metadata about maintainers can be extracted from DESCRIPTION in
various ways. As of October 2022, we focus on the use of the ORCID field
which is an optional <code>comment</code> component in a
<code>person</code> element. For example, in the DESCRIPTION for the
AnVIL package we have</p>
<pre><code>Authors@R:
    c(person(
        "Martin", "Morgan", role = c("aut", "cre"),
        email = "mtmorgan.bioc@gmail.com",
        comment = c(ORCID = "0000-0002-5874-8148")
     ),</code></pre>
<p>This convention is used for a fair number of Bioconductor and CRAN
packages.</p>
<p>We’ll demonstrate the use of <code>get_cre_orcids</code> with some
packages.</p>
